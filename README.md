## Overview of Network Configuration

This describes the following setting example.
```
     eNodeB                Docker host - 172.22.0.0/24
   +---------+           +-------------+
   |         |           |             |
   |         |           |             |
   +---------+           +-------------+
        |                       |
-------------------------------------------------------
       .10                     .20      192.168.0.0/24
```
For reference, the Docker host VM on VirtualBox I have tried is as follows:
| CPU Cores | Memory | SSD | OS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 4GB | 40GB | Ubuntu 22.04 |

For eNodeB, set static routing to eNodeB for packets going from eNodeB to the Docker host network (`172.22.0.0/24`).
```
# ip route add 172.22.0.0/24 via 192.168.0.20
```
If eNodeB does not have a static routing setting function, build a network so that the Docker host becomes the default GW.

The PDNs are as follows.
| PDN | TUNnel interface of PDN | APN | U-Plane # |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 192.168.100.0/24 | ogstun | internet | U-Plane1 |
| 192.168.101.0/24 | ogstun2 | ims | U-Plane1 |

<a id="branch_open5gs"></a>

## Use open5gs_hss_cx branch of docker_open5gs

For **VoLTE** and **SMS over IMS** / **SMS over SGs**, it is convenient to use `open5gs_hss_cx` branch.
Kamailio's S-CSCF and I-CSCF communicate with Open5GS HSS(Cx).  
**Note.** For **SMS over SGs** of docker_open5gs, 2G/3G radio access is not used at all rather it uses only the core network (MSC + SMSC + HLR).
```
# git clone https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs
# cd docker_open5gs
# git checkout open5gs_hss_cx
```

<a id="build"></a>

### Build docker image for Open5GS and Kamailio

Please install the following first.
- [docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu)

See [docker_open5gs](https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs) for build instructions.
```
# cd docker_open5gs/base
# docker build --no-cache --force-rm -t docker_open5gs .
...
# cd ../ims_base
# docker build --no-cache --force-rm -t docker_kamailio .
...
```

<a id="run"></a>

### Run docker-compose

For example, I prepare terminals for each of the following NF groups and execute them in order while checking the startup.

*terminal#1*
```
# set -a
# source .env
# docker compose -f 4g-volte-deploy.yaml up mongo mysql dns webui
```
*terminal#2*
```
# set -a
# source .env
# docker compose -f 4g-volte-deploy.yaml up osmohlr osmomsc
```
*terminal#3*
```
# set -a
# source .env
# docker compose -f 4g-volte-deploy.yaml up hss mme pcrf sgwc sgwu smf upf
```
*terminal#4*
```
# set -a
# source .env
# docker compose -f 4g-volte-deploy.yaml up rtpengine
```
*terminal#5*
```
# set -a
# source .env
# docker compose -f 4g-volte-deploy.yaml up icscf scscf pcscf smsc
```

<a id="register_open5gs"></a>

### Register subscribers information with Open5GS

**Please also register MSISDN.** At that time, set the APN setting information as follows.
| APN | Type | QCI | ARP | Capability | Vulnerablility | MBR DL/UL(Kbps) | GBR DL/UL(Kbps) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| internet | IPv4 | 9 | 8 | Disabled | Disabled | unlimited/unlimited | |
| ims | IPv4 | 5 | 1 | Disabled | Disabled | 3850/1530 | |
| | | 1 | 2 | Enabled | Enabled | 128/128 | 128/128 |

See below for details.

`18. Install Open5GS in the same machine as Kamailio IMS - Install Open5GS from source`  
https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/tutorial/02-VoLTE-setup/

```
http://192.168.0.20:3000/

user: admin
password: 1423
```

<a id="register_osmocom"></a>

### Register the IMSI and MSISDN with OsmoHLR

Please login to the `osmohlr` container and register by referring to the following.

`6.1 Example: Add/Update/Delete Subscriber via VTY`  
https://downloads.osmocom.org/docs/latest/osmohlr-usermanual.pdf

The following is an example of registering subscriber information for IMSI=001010000001001 and MSISDN=1001.

First, login to the `osmohlr` container.
```
# docker exec -it osmohlr /bin/bash
```
Then telnet to localhost.
```
# telnet localhost 4258
...
OsmoHLR> enable
OsmoHLR#
```
Next, register the subscriber information for IMSI=001010000001001 and MSISDN=1001.
```
OsmoHLR# subscriber imsi 001010000001001 create
% Created subscriber 001010000001001
    ID: 1
    IMSI: 001010000001001
    MSISDN: none
OsmoHLR# subscriber imsi 001010000001001 update msisdn 1001
% Updated subscriber IMSI='001010000001001' to MSISDN='1001'
OsmoHLR#
```
Make sure this subscriber information is registered.
```
OsmoHLR# show subscribers all
ID     MSISDN        IMSI              IMEI              NAM
-----  ------------  ----------------  ----------------  -----
1      1001          001010000001001    -------------    CSPS  
 Subscribers Shown: 1
OsmoHLR#
```
This setting is required to function as **SMS over SGs**.

<a id="try"></a>

### Try VoLTE and SMS

Make sure that you can make a VoLTE call and SMS to the MSISDN. If your device does not support **SMS over IMS**, you can send SMS with **SMS over SGs** depending on your device.  
**Note. To try SMS over SGs, there is a way to cause CS Fallback by not running the smsc container.**

<a id="osmomsc_send_command"></a>

### Send SMS from OsmoMSC VTY terminal (SMS over SGs)

You can send SMS to the destination terminal by command operation on the OsmoMSC VTY terminal (SMS over SGs).
Please login to the `osmomsc` container and send SMS from the command line as following.

`14 Configuring the Core Network`  
`11.3.3 The list command`  
https://downloads.osmocom.org/docs/latest/osmomsc-usermanual.pdf

**For example, if the following IMSI and MSISDN are registered in OsmoHLR)**
| IMSI | MSISDN | SIM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 001010000001000 | 1000 | x |
| 001010000001001 | 1001 | o |
| 001010000001002 | 1002 | o |

First, login to the `osmomsc` container.
```
# docker exec -it osmomsc /bin/bash
```
Then telnet to localhost.
```
# telnet localhost 4254
...
OsmoMSC> enable
OsmoMSC#
```

- Command line to send SMS from MSISDN=1001 to MSISDN=1002 where the corresponding SIM exists
```
OsmoMSC# subscriber msisdn 1002 sms sender msisdn 1001 send TEST MESSAGE
```
- Command line to send SMS from MSISDN=1000 to MSISDN=1002 for which there is no corresponding SIM
```
OsmoMSC# subscriber msisdn 1002 sms sender msisdn 1000 send TEST MESSAGE
```

<a id="use_only_ims"></a>

## Use only SMS over IMS without using SMS over SGs

It is also possible to configure only **SMS over IMS** without using **SMS over SGs**.
In this case, OsmoHLR and OsmoMSC are not required and the configuration is slightly simple.

<a id="add_change_config"></a>

### Additional changes in configuration files of docker_open5gs

Additional changes from the previously written configuration are as follows.

**4g-volte-deploy.yaml)**

Publish the following ports of SGW-U and MME, and delete MME's dependency on OsmoMSC.

From here on, follow the same steps as before. Also, the `osmohlr` and `osmomsc` containers do not need to be started. And there is no need to register the IMSI and MSISDN with OsmoHLR.

## VoLTE and SMS with Raspberry Pi 4B

When you try VoLTE and SMS with Raspberry Pi 4B,
as shown [here](https://github.com/s5uishida/install_mongodb_on_ubuntu_for_rp4b), there is a limit to the version of MongoDB that can be installed on the Raspberry Pi 4B.
So make the necessary changes on docker_open5gs for this.

<a id="rp4b_mongodb"></a>

### Change how to create the docker image and container of MongoDB

First, clone this repository.
```
# git clone https://github.com/s5uishida/docker_open5gs_volte_sms_config
```
Copy the `mongo_for_rp4` directory from this repository as the `mongo` directory in the `open5gs_hss_cx` branch of docker_open5gs.
```
# cp -pr docker_open5gs_volte_sms_config/mongo_for_rp4 docker_open5gs/mongo
```
Then, for `4g-volte-deploy.yaml`, in addition to [this change](https://github.com/s5uishida/docker_open5gs_volte_sms_config#changes-in-configuration-files-of-docker_open5gs), change as follows.

After this, the configuration and build are the same as above.
I haven't confirmed the operation, but it is probably able to use VoLTE and SMS with Raspberry Pi 4B.

---

[docker_open5gs](https://github.com/herlesupreeth/docker_open5gs) is a excellent software to try **VoLTE** and **SMS** easily. I would like to thank all the software developers and contributors related.

<a id="ver_list"></a>

## Confirmed Version List

The system versions when I confirmed the operation of VoLTE and SMS in the `open5gs_hss_cx` branch of my environment are as follows.

| docker_open5gs | Open5GS |
